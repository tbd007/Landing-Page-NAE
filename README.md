# Project
Landing Page for N.A.E. Cosmetics New Collection Concept

# Description
The goal was to create a landing page concept for a natural cosmetics brand with brief introduction to the brand itself and
interactive showcase of the new products. 

Using a dynamically created Navigation located untypically at the bottom of the page, the navigation menu can be 
automatically updated whenever a new content section is added or removed.
The nav-bar dissapears when the user is not scrolling.
